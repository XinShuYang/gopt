For each packet, perform DEPTH number of dependent lookups.
	
When the lookups for packets are independent, there can be several
memory accesses in flight due to loop unrolling.
	
As DEPTH becomes larger, fewer memory accesses for a packet can
be overlapped with memory accesses for a different packet.

Cost of a memory access with increasing DEPTH:
	
	DEPTH				Cost (ns)
	1					11 ns
	4					14 ns
	16 					34 ns
	80					77 ns
	160 				85 ns
	...
	Inf					90 ns
