Directory structure:
===================
	antlr:
	======
		ANTLR code to transform code using goto optimization.

		antlr/actual:
		============
			Sample applications for benchmarking the transformation.

	l2fwd:
	=====
		DPDK code for packet-processing benchmarks.

	gpu:
	====
		Microbenchmarks for GPU performance.

		gpu/bandwidth:
		=============
			Measure transfer bandwidth b/w CPU and GPU.

		gpu/compute:
		============
			Compare compute performance of CPU and GPU. Contains a knob to 
			include/exclude memcpy time.

		gpu/mappedMemory:
		================
			Experiments to measure GPU performance when mapped-memory polling
			is used for CPU/GPU transfers. Contains experiments to measure
			the minimum time, the time when some compute is done on the GPU,
			and the time when some global memory accesses are done.

		gpu/randMem:
		===========
			Compare random memory performance of CPU and GPU. Contains a knob 
			to include/exclude memcpy time.

		gpu/memcpyTime:
		==============
			Prints breakdown of CPU-GPU-CPU communication into memcpy time,
			kernel launch time, and synchronization time. Contains two
			experiments using async and sync CUDA functions.

		gpu/seqMem:
		===========
			Prelim experiment to measure sequential memory bandwidth of a GPU.
