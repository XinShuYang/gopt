The fastpp compiler takes a packet-processing function as input and 
transforms it to a new function with the \texttt{goto} optimzation. This document 
describes the constraints on the input function $F$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $F$ should process a batch of input packets. The reservered macro
\texttt{BATCH\_SIZE} defines the size of the batch processed by one invocation
of $F$. $F$ should begin with a \texttt{foreach} loop. The first line of $F$ should be
\texttt{foreach(batch\_index, BATCH\_SIZE)}. The \texttt{foreach} construct
translates to a standard for loop: 
\texttt{for(batch\_index = 0; batch\_index < BATCH\_SIZE; batch\_index ++)}.



\end{enumerate}
