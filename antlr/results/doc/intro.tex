The \texttt{fastpp} compiler takes a packet-processing function as input and 
transforms it to a new function with the \texttt{goto} optimzation. This document 
describes the constraints on the input function $\mathscr{F}$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathscr{F}$ should process a batch of input packets. The reservered macro
\texttt{BATCH\_SIZE} defines the size of the batch processed by one invocation
of $\mathscr{F}$.
\end{enumerate}
