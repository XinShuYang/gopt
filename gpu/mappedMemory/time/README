mappedMemory.cu:
===============

	Benchmark to measure the minimum time for CPU-GPU communication for a variable
	number of integers with polling on mapped memory.

	main() takes the number of integers (num_pkts) to communicate to the GPU as an
	argument. It runs ITERS iterations of mapped memory-based communication, and
	records the total time for each iteration.

	Output for each run of main():
		* The average, 5th percentile, and 95th percentile, of total communcation time
		  measured over all iterations.

run.sh:
=======

	Runs main() with different values of num_pkts.

	Output:
		* The 5th percentile for each value of num_pkts.
