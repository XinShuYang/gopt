Directory structure:
===================
	
	bandwidth:
	==========
		Prints the CPU-GPU data transfer bandwidth using pinned and non-pinned
		memory. Prints wrong values sometimes - run multiple times to get an
		idea of the PCIe bandwidth.

	compute:
	========
		Compares the rate of hash-computation on CPU and GPU. A compile-time
		option can include or exclude the time taken to transfer the data
		to the GPU.

	randMem:
	========
		Compares the rate of random memory accesses on CPU and GPU. A compile-time
		option can include or exclude the time taken to transfer the data
		to the GPU.

	memcpyTime:
	===========
		Benchmarks to measure the time required to involve a GPU in computation
		using synchronous and asynchronous CUDA functions. Prints the breakdown
		of the time into h2d memcpy, kernel launch, and d2h memcpy.

	mappedMemory:
	=============
		Benchmarks to measure GPU involvement time, random memory access rate,
		and hash-computation rate when the data is transferred to and from the
		GPU using polling on mapped memory.
