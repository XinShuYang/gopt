ALERT:
======
	The packets file here contains only 150K packets to save space. I've tested
	with 2 million packets with similar (or sometimes slightly higher performance).
	The full file with 2 million packets is in /mnt/ssd/akalia/snort/ on
	xia-router2.

snort_valid_rules:
==================
	uncommented rules from Snort 2.9.7's community rules.

snort_dfa_patterns:
===================
	patterns inserted by Snort 2.9.7 with detection = ac-q, and no max-length

snort_packets:
==============
	packets matched by Snort against its DFAs for the DARPA dataset

packet_sz_dist:
===============
	distribution of packet sizes matched by Snort for the DARPA dataset

proc.java:
==========
	2 input files:

		snort_dfa_patterns:
		===================
			<dfa_pointer> <ptrn_len> <byte 1> ...
		
		snort_packets:
		==============
			<dfa_pointer> <pkt_len> <byte 1> ...

	Converts the dfa_pointer in both files to an integer (dfa_id)
