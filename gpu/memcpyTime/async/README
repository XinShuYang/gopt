memcpyTime.cu:
==============

	Benchmark to measure the minimum time for CPU-GPU communication for a variable
	number of integers with asynchronous CUDA functions.

	main() takes the number of integers (num_pkts) to communicate to the GPU as an
	argument. It runs ITERS iterations of memcpy (h2d), kernel launch, and memcpy
	(d2h) and records the time for each step.

	Output for each run of main():
		* The time division for each iteration.
		* The average, 5th percentile, and 95th percentile of total communication
		  time measured over all iterations.

run.sh:
=======

	Runs main() with different values of num_pkts.

	Output:
		* The 5th percentile for each value of num_pkts.
