Assumption
===========

Incoming packets can only match terminal prefixes. For example, if we
have *only* two inserted URLs:

	com/google/maps/ --> Port #1
	com/google/drive/ --> Port #2

and a incoming packet has destination URL /com/google/, our outbound port
is undefined. The algorithm *does* need to have a defined outbound port 
if the URL com/google/ was also present.



Inserting a URL into the NDN hash table:
========================================

The URL is inserted by breaking it down into prefixes at component boundaries.
For example, the URL com/google/maps leads to the insertion of three prefixes:

	com/ -> non terminal
	com/google/ -> non terminal
	com/google/maps/ -> terminal


	Requirements for insertion:
	===========================

	1. Non-terminal prefixes should *not* have an outbound port.
	2. Terminal prefixes should have an outbound port.

	
	Overwriting existing prefixes:
	==============================

	As the existing prefix has an entry in the log (ht_log), it needs to be 
	updated.

	1. Overwriting a non-terminal prefix with a terminal prefix: the port
	field and the "is_terminal" field in the log entry need to be changed.

	2. Overwriting a terminal prefix with a non-terminal prefix: no changes
	need to be made.



Semantics of "terminal" prefixes:
=================================

A terminal prefix does not mean that the LPM should stop here. It only means
that the LPM *could* stop here if the URL that we're looking up does not
have more components.


10M FIB stats (Tsinghua FIB)
============================

This is the 10-million entry FIB from the NDN papers by Prof. Bin Liu and 
students.

	974 URLs have 1 components
	7086509 URLs have 2 components
	1888029 URLs have 3 components
	259022 URLs have 4 components
	16980 URLs have 5 components
	1268 URLs have 6 components
	288 URLs have 7 components
	12 URLs have 8 components
	2 URLs have 9 components

20% of the URLs have 3 components.

The "Fast Name Lookup for Named Data Networking" (IWQoS) paper claims that 
15.4% of their URLs have 3 components. That is for the smaller FIB with 3 
million entries.
