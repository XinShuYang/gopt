Changes to C.g4 - divergence from ANSI C grammar:

1. Use `initDeclaratorList` instead of `initDeclaratorList?` in the declaration
rule. If this is not done, [code] int a; [\code] is interpreted wrongly.
Both `int` and `a` are matched to `declarationSpecifier`, but we need the `a`
to match `initDeclarator`.

2. A `directDeclarator` cannot be `(declarator)`. If this is not done,
[code] foo(a) [\code] is interpreted as a `declarator`, not as a `postfixExpression`.
